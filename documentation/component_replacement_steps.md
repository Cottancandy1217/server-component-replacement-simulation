# Server RAM Replacement Steps

This document outlines the step-by-step procedure for replacing a faulty RAM module in a server.

## 1. Preparation

* **1.1 Identify the Faulty Component:**
    * Review system logs, error messages, and diagnostic reports to confirm that a RAM module is the likely cause of the server's issues.
    * Note the specific RAM module that needs to be replaced (e.g., DIMM slot number, manufacturer, capacity).
* **1.2 Gather Necessary Tools and Equipment:**
    * Anti-static wrist strap and grounding cable.
    * Screwdrivers (as needed for the server chassis).
    * New, compatible RAM module.
    * Server manufacturer's documentation.
    * Labels (optional, for marking components).
* **1.3 Schedule Maintenance Window:**
    * Plan the replacement during a maintenance window to minimize disruption to users.
    * Communicate the scheduled downtime to relevant stakeholders.

## 2. Server Shutdown and Disconnection

* **2.1 Graceful Shutdown:**
    * Perform a graceful shutdown of the server operating system to prevent data corruption.
* **2.2 Power Disconnection:**
    * Disconnect the server from the power source.
* **2.3 Cable Disconnection:**
    * Disconnect all peripheral cables (network, keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.).
    * Label cables if necessary to ensure proper reconnection.

## 3. Server Chassis Access

* **3.1 Grounding:**
    * Attach the anti-static wrist strap and connect the grounding cable to a grounded point on the server chassis.
* **3.2 Open Chassis:**
    * Follow the server manufacturer's instructions to open the server chassis.
    * If necessary, use screwdrivers to remove access panels.

## 4. RAM Module Replacement

* **4.1 Locate RAM Modules:**
    * Refer to the server motherboard diagram or manufacturer's documentation to locate the RAM module slots.
* **4.2 Remove Faulty Module:**
    * Gently release the retention clips on both ends of the RAM module slot.
    * Carefully remove the faulty RAM module by pulling it straight up.
    * Place the faulty module in an anti-static bag.
* **4.3 Install New Module:**
    * Align the new RAM module with the slot, ensuring the notch on the module aligns with the key in the slot.
    * Gently push the module straight down until the retention clips lock into place.
    * Verify that the module is firmly seated.

## 5. Server Reassembly and Reconnection

* **5.1 Close Chassis:**
    * Reassemble the server chassis according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    * Ensure all panels are securely fastened.
* **5.2 Reconnect Cables:**
    * Reconnect all peripheral cables, referring to labels if used.
* **5.3 Power Reconnection:**
    * Reconnect the server to the power source.

## 6. Server Power On and Verification

* **6.1 Power On:**
    * Power on the server.
* **6.2 BIOS/UEFI Verification:**
    * Enter the BIOS/UEFI setup and verify that the new RAM module is recognized and the total memory capacity is correct.
* **6.3 Operating System Boot:**
    * Allow the operating system to boot.
* **6.4 Memory Diagnostics:**
    * Run memory diagnostic tools (e.g., Memtest86+) to verify the new RAM module's functionality.
* **6.5 System Monitoring:**
    * Monitor system logs and performance for any errors or instability.

## 7. Documentation

* **7.1 Update Inventory:**
    * Update the server's hardware inventory to reflect the new RAM module.
* **7.2 Record Maintenance Details:**
    * Document the date, time, and details of the RAM replacement in the server's maintenance log.
* **7.3 Store Faulty Component:**
    * Store the faulty RAM module in a designated location for future analysis or disposal.
