# Server Component Replacement Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates the replacement of a faulty RAM module in a server. The goal is to document the process, demonstrate hardware troubleshooting skills, and showcase attention to detail, which are essential for a Google Data Center Technician role.

## Incident Simulation Description

A server is experiencing frequent crashes and memory errors, as indicated by system logs and user reports. After initial troubleshooting, the technician suspects a faulty RAM module.

## Step-by-Step Component Replacement

1.  **Power Down the Server:** Safely power down the server and disconnect all power and network cables.
2.  **ESD Precautions:** Wear an anti-static wrist strap and ensure proper grounding.
3.  **Open the Server Chassis:** Follow the server manufacturer's instructions to open the chassis.
4.  **Identify the Faulty RAM Module:** Locate the RAM modules. Based on error logs, identify the specific module to be replaced.
5.  **Remove the Faulty Module:** Carefully release the retention clips and remove the faulty RAM module.
6.  **Install the New RAM Module:** Align the new RAM module with the slot and gently push it in until the retention clips lock.
7.  **Close the Server Chassis:** Reassemble the server chassis.
8.  **Reconnect Cables:** Reconnect all power and network cables.
9.  **Power On the Server:** Power on the server and monitor the boot process.

## Troubleshooting (if any)

[If you simulated any troubleshooting steps, add them here. For example:]

* Checked system logs for memory errors.
* Ran memory diagnostics from the BIOS/UEFI.

## BIOS/UEFI Configuration

[If you made any changes to the BIOS/UEFI, document them here. For example:]

* Verified that the new RAM module is recognized by the system.
* Adjusted boot order if necessary.

## Verification

[Describe how you verified the server's functionality. For example:]

* Ran memory diagnostics.
* Monitored system logs for errors.
* Tested application functionality.

## Lessons Learned

* Importance of ESD precautions.
* Following manufacturer's instructions.
* Thorough documentation.

## Network Diagram

[Add your network diagram here, if applicable. If it is only a server, then you can leave this out.]
